# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Mongo DB](https://mongodb.com/)

For Deployment and CI/CD, we have used the following technologies:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
